# Loan Status Prediction
## Trained classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier on data set to find the best the algorithm.
## The best-performing models after hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV were Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier, both achieving an accuracy of around 80%.
